# Agentic Constitutional Lab

This repository is a **shadow laboratory** studying agentic AI behavior under real-world economic and operational constraints.

It mirrors tasks and patterns emerging from live agent hackathons (e.g. autonomous code generation, deployment, and governance),
and evaluates how different agent architectures behave when those tasks intersect with **ethical, constitutional, and safety invariants**.

## What this repo is
- A comparative lab for agent behavior
- A demonstration of *ethical failure tasks*
- A reference architecture for **constitutionally bound agents**

## What this repo is not
- Not a hackathon submission
- Not a production agent framework
- Not a general-purpose automation tool

## Core idea

Many agents can complete tasks.

This lab focuses on agents that can:
- detect when a task violates an invariant
- refuse execution correctly
- explain the refusal
- propose safer alternatives

In this system, **refusal is a success condition**, not a failure.

## Status
🧪 Experimental  
🧠 Early research  
⚠️ Intentionally minimal

Further documentation will be added as the lab evolves.
